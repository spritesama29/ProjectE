# ProjectE
To test the 5 steps of project E, we changed the main to have the execute shell to be above the makeTImerInterrupt and corrected the terminate and it ran great. For dividing the work in the project. Sean did the readLine of project B and Scott and I worked on the rest of B together. For project C, Sean worked on a readFile that didn't end up working sadly. Scott and I did C together by working together in a study room for a couple days but Sean couldn't make it because of work. Sean worked on the steps in D while Scott and I worked on E. We all had one last group meeting together and then I finished up E on my own.
